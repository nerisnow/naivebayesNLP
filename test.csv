Wow... Loved this place.,1
The fries were great too.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
Their chow mein is so good!,1
We'd definitely go back here again.,1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
The service was meh.,0
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.",0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1
This place has it!,1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
Best breakfast buffet!!!,1
Will be back again!,1
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!",1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
Will go back next trip out.,1
It was pretty gross!,0
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.",0
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.",1
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.",0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,1
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",0
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.",1
Bacon is hella salty.,1
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",1
The waitresses are very friendly.,1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,1
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,0
What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.",1
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
Very friendly staff.,1
Must have been an off night at this place.,0
"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.",0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.,1
Won't go back.,0
Extremely Tasty!,1
The service was a bit lacking.,0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
Very very fun chef.,1
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.",0
"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).",1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.",0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!,1
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0
Just don't know why they were so slow.,0
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.",0
"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.",1
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.,0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.,0
The food was very good.,1
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.",0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,1
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.",1
You won't be disappointed.,1
"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.",0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.,0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,0
"Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.",1
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.,1
"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.",1
Pretty cool I would say.,1
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.,1
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.,0
Best tacos in town by far!!,1
I took back my money and got outta there.,0
"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.",0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
This one is simply a disappointment.,0
"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.",0
Left very frustrated.,0
I'll definitely be in soon again.,1
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
I really enjoyed eating here.,1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.,1
"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!",0
"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.",1
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!,1
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.,1
I was so insulted.,0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.,0
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.",1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.",0
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.,1
"I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.",0
Reasonably priced also!,1
Everything was perfect the night we were in.,1
"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.",0
"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.",1
"A greasy, unhealthy meal.",0
"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.",1
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.,0
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.",1
"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.",0
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.,1
"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!",1
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
After two I felt disgusting.,0
AN HOUR... seriously?,0
"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.",1
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.,0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.,0
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.,1
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.,1
The food is good.,1
I just wanted to leave.,0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!,0
"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(",0
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.,0
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.",0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.,0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,0
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!,1
"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.",0
This is a good joint.,1
The Macarons here are insanely good.,1
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
The fried rice was dry as well.,0
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!,1
"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!",1
Both great!,1
Eclectic selection.,1
Damn good steak.,1
Total brunch fail.,0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,0
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!",1
It was way over fried.,0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
Will not be back!,0
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.,1
"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!",1
The service was poor and thats being nice.,0
"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.",1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.,0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.,1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.,0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.,0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!,1
"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.",1
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.,1
"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.",1
I'm super pissd.,0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!,0
I love this place.,1
This place should honestly be blown up.,0
Very poor service.,0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,0
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.",1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,0
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.",1
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,1
-My order was not correct.,0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
This place lacked style!!,0
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",0
It was equally awful.,0
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.",0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.",0
